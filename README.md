Consider the web-server log in the sample file attached
Write a shell script (zsh/bash) that parses this file and outputs the following:
  1. the number of HTTP 200 errors in it
  2. a list of all HTTP response codes in the log and their count
You may download the log file and save it locally for testing purposes. For the second part, your script must find all response codes in a generic fashion, you should not hard-code searches for a known list of response codes.


Execute ruby logreader.rb
